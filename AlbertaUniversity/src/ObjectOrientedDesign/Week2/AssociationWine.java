// Association:
// there is a loose relationship between two objects.
//These objects may interact with each other for some time.
//For example, an object of a class may use services/methods provided by object of
//another class.
//If one object is destroyed, the other can continue to exist.
//There can be any number of each item in the relationship.
//One object does not belong to another.

public class AssociationWine {
    public void pair(Food food) {

    }
}

// the wine can exist independent of the food.
//It does not need food to exist, nor does it always have food.
//The two objects interact with each other without belonging to one another.


//Overall, association is a loose partnership between two objects that exist
//completely independently.
//They have numbers that are not tied to each other
